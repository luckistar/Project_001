In the projects below, I am going to go over some control flow related taks
# 03/08/2023 Project_001
    Project_001 codecademy_challenges
 We are creating a function has two parameters base and exponent. We want to test out the output which is base to the power. If the output is larger than or equal to 5000 then return True, else return False. and we can also test it with different value of base and power. It works
 # 03/13/2023 Project_002
    Project_002 codecademy_challenges
we are creating a function with five parameters. We will be comparing the budget with the sum of the other four expenses. If the budget is less than the spending then return True, otherwise return False
 remember to space out codes
# 03/13/2023 Project_003
    Project_003 codecademy_challenges
We are going to compare the value of num1 and two times the num2, if the num1 is greater than num2*2 then return True, else return False
# 03/13/2023 Project_004
    Project_004 codecademy_challenges
We are going to see if the num is divisible by 10, if the remainder is 0 means it is divisible by 10 and it returns True, else it is not divisible by 10 and return False
# 03/13/2023 Project_005
    Project_005 codecademy_challenges
We are going to see if the num1 and num2 add up to 10, if it does then return False, Else return True. 
# 03/15/2023 Project_001_advanced
    Project_001_advanced codecademy_challenges
In this project we are going to do some advanced control flow problems. We are going to test if the number falls into certain range. We define the function with three parameters, a number (num), lower number(lower), upper number (uppper), then we compare the number we have with the range to see if the numbr is within the range if yes then return True, else return False
# 03/15/2023 Project_002_advanced
    Project_002_advanced codecademy_challenges
In this project, we are going to compare two strings to see if they are equal. If they are return true, else return false

# 03/15/2023 Project_003_advanced
    Project_003_advanced codecademy_challenges
We are going to prove that sometimes conditional statements does not work even if your code does not give you any errors. We first define a function with one parameter (number) and we put a contradiction statements for example if the number is bigger than and less than one random number at the same time, if yes return True, else return False. 
# 03/15/2023 Project_004_advanced
    Project_004_advanced codecademy_challenges
We are going to compare the movie rating. If the rating is less than or equal to 5, then we return "Avoid at all costs!". If the rating is between 5 and 9, then return "This one was fun." If it is over 9, then return "Oudstanding!"
# 03/15/2023 Project_005_advanced
    Project_005_advanced codecademy_challenges
In this project, we are going to define a function with three paramter; num1, num2, num3. We are trying to compare numbers to find the largest number between them. If any of them are equal and largest, then return "It's a tie!"
# 03/18/2023 Project_list_001
In this project, we are going to use len() return the length of the list, it shows you how many items are inside of the list. We are also gonna use .append() to add items on end of the list. It will add exact items to paranthesis.
# 03/18/2023 Project_list_002
In this project, we are going to add the last two elements from the list and then add the sum to end of the list. Do it three more time. We use going to use range() to run through the iteration and keep adding the sum till end of the list
# 03/19/2023 Project_list_003
In this project, we are going to compare the items in two lists. If one list has more items than the other list then return the last item of the list has more item. If both lists have equal amount of items, then return the last item of the first list
# 03/19/2023 Project_list_004
In this project, we are going to count one specific item that is appearing in our list, and compare the amount of this item and most popular item amount. If this item has more amount than most popular item then return True, Else return False
# 03/20/2023 Project_list_005
In this project we are going to combine two lists and sort the new list and return it. We are using sorted() instead of sort(), because I want to keep the original list as well
