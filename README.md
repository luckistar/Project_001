In the projects below, I am going to go over some control flow related taks
# 03/08/2023 Project_001
    Project_001 codecademy_challenges
 We are creating a function has two parameters base and exponent. We want to test out the output which is base to the power. If the output is larger than or equal to 5000 then return True, else return False. and we can also test it with different value of base and power. It works
 # 03/13/2023 Project_002
    Project_002 codecademy_challenges
we are creating a function with five parameters. We will be comparing the budget with the sum of the other four expenses. If the budget is less than the spending then return True, otherwise return False
 remember to space out codes
# 03/13/2023 Project_003
    Project_003 codecademy_challenges
We are going to compare the value of num1 and two times the num2, if the num1 is greater than num2*2 then return True, else return False
# 03/13/2023 Project_004
    Project_004 codecademy_challenges
We are going to see if the num is divisible by 10, if the remainder is 0 means it is divisible by 10 and it returns True, else it is not divisible by 10 and return False
# 03/13/2023 Project_005
    Project_005 codecademy_challenges
We are going to see if the num1 and num2 add up to 10, if it does then return False, Else return True. 
# 03/15/2023 Project_001_advanced
    Project_001_advanced codecademy_challenges
In this project we are going to do some advanced control flow problems. We are going to test if the number falls into certain range. We define the function with three parameters, a number (num), lower number(lower), upper number (uppper), then we compare the number we have with the range to see if the numbr is within the range if yes then return True, else return False
# 03/15/2023 Project_002_advanced
    Project_002_advanced codecademy_challenges
In this project, we are going to compare two strings to see if they are equal. If they are return true, else return false
